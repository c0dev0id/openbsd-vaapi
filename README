This is WIP and not building yet.

TODO:
 - make libva build, the build system wants to rebuild configure.ac but it
   shouldn't.
 - glue code for lib/mesa. The original patch sets --enable-va in the mesa
   Makefile. Mesa since has been changed to meson. va needs to be enabled
   here.

----

1. execute ./backup_xenocara.sh
    This will rsync /usr/xenocara to the backup directory.

2. execute ./install_vaapi.sh
    This will restore xenocara, then download/patch/install vaapi and the
build xenocara

If you want to update xenocara from cvs:
    1. run ./restore_xenocara.sh
    2. update from cvs
    3. run ./backup_xenocara.sh

*Read the install_vaapi.sh script, it has some user specific stuff (chmod) in
it and builds xenocara at the end. you may not want this.*

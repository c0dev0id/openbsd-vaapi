It contains:

 - vainfo
 - libva(-drm)
 - intel-vaapi-driver

----

1. execute ./backup_xenocara.sh
    This will rsync /usr/xenocara to the backup directory.

2. execute ./install_vaapi.sh
    This will restore xenocara, then download/patch/install vaapi and the
build xenocara

If you want to update xenocara from cvs:
    1. run ./restore_xenocara.sh
    2. update from cvs
    3. run ./backup_xenocara.sh

*Read the install_vaapi.sh script, it has some user specific stuff (chmod) in
it and builds xenocara at the end. you may not want this.*
